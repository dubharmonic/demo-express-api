# demo-server-express-restful-api

This project is a simple demo of a RESTful JSON API written with ECMAScript 6 and Express. It's a continual work in progress.

1) You'll need a Postres 9.6 database running, and a `DATABASE_URL` env variable set with the connection string.

2) Install dependencies

        yarn install

3) Create the table

        yarn db-init

4) Run the tests

        yarn coverage
    
5) Start the server

        yarn dev
        
The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`
